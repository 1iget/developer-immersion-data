CONCLUSION
====

You've now learned how to improve the performance of the audit table using In-Memory OLTP. The new table is optimized to be efficient in terms of performance for high-concurreny scenarios. In addition, there is no contention problem at all, since the In-Memory table also solves the IO issues usually seen in this kind of scenarios.
