REPLACING THE TABLE
====

In this page you'll replace the existing WebAudit table in order to use the In Memory OLTP feature.

1. Before creating the table, SQL Server should have a FileGroup prepared to the InMemory feature. Execute this code:

    ```sql
        ALTER DATABASE [Expenses]
            ADD FILEGROUP MEMORYOPTIMIZATIONFG  
            CONTAINS MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_DATA;  

        GO

        ALTER DATABASE [Expenses]
            ADD FILE  
            (  
            NAME = N'FileMemOptima1',  
            FILENAME = N'c:\FileMemOptimization1'  
            )  
        TO FILEGROUP MEMORYOPTIMIZATIONFG;
    ```

    The first ALTER is to create the file group. Note the *MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_DATA* option. The second one is to create a file inside the new filegroup. 

2. The next step is to remove the existing stored procedure:

    ```sql
    DROP PROCEDURE [Audit].[usp_Audit]
    ```

3. And finally, to remove the existing Audit table:

    ```sql
    DROP TABLE [Audit].[WebAudit]
    ```

4. Now the Audit table will be created but using In-Memory OLTP feature:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE [Audit].[WebAudit](
        [Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED NOT NULL,
        [Email] [nvarchar](60) NOT NULL,
        [Path] [nvarchar](255) NULL,
        [RequestContent] [nvarchar](max) NULL,
        [Verb] [varchar](10) NULL,
        [ResponseCode] [nvarchar](3) NULL,
        [ResponseContent] [nvarchar](max) NULL,
        [Date] [datetime2](7) NOT NULL
    ) WITH (MEMORY_OPTIMIZED=ON);

    GO
    ```

    Note the last flag, *MEMORY_OPTIMIZED=ON*. This is the flag that indicates the table will use the In-Memory OLTP feature over the file created before.

5. The final step is to create the stored procedure again. This time, as the table is using the In-Memory OLTP feature, the procedure will be native compiled. Natively compiled stored procedures allow for efficient execution of the queries and business logic in the stored procedure. One difference between interpreted (disk-based) stored procedures and natively compiled stored procedures is that an interpreted stored procedure is compiled at first execution, whereas a natively compiled stored procedure is compiled when it is created. This will improve the performance in the execution of the procedure.

    ```sql
        CREATE PROCEDURE [Audit].usp_Audit
            @Email [nvarchar](60),
            @Path [nvarchar](255), 
            @RequestContent [nvarchar](max),
            @Verb [varchar](10),
            @ResponseCode [nvarchar](3),
            @ResponseContent [nvarchar](max)  
            WITH NATIVE_COMPILATION, SCHEMABINDING   
            AS   
            BEGIN ATOMIC   
                WITH (TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL = SNAPSHOT, LANGUAGE = N'us_english')  
                INSERT INTO [Audit].[WebAudit]([Email], [Path], [RequestContent], [Verb], [ResponseCode], [ResponseContent], [Date])
                VALUES (@Email, @Path, @RequestContent, @Verb, @ResponseCode, @ResponseContent, GETDATE())  
            END
        GO
    ```

    The *NATIVE_COMPILATION* is the flag to mark the procedure as native compilated. It can be used only over In-Memory tables.
