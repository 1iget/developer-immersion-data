CHECKING THE SECURITY
====

NOTE: This page is provided only for information purposes, since the Node.js driver doesn't support Always Encrypted yet. You don't have to apply these steps to the existing application.

1. As you saw in the previous page, Always Encrypted works at the driver level. That means that the communication between the application and the SQL Server instance will be encrypted, so you'll be getting encryption at rest and in transit. In the previous steps, the BankAccountNumber was encrypted and when executing a SELECT query in the SSMS, the information is not avaiable. This can be fixed if we add the following options to the conection:

	With this option, the client will use the encryption keys when connecting to the SQL Server instance.

2. In addition, [Extended Events](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb630282.aspx) can be used to retrieve the traces in the communication between the client application and the SQL Server instance. For example, check the following query:

	```sql
	SELECT * FROM [Expense].[Employee] WHERE BankAccountNumber = '03534343437867564987904'
	```

	If the query is executed with the "Column Encryption Setting=enabled" flag the driver will take care of the encryption / decryption process. In any other scenario the query will fail because you don't have permissions to query the encrypted data, but with the flag, you are going to query with the actual value of the field, not the encrypted one. However, if we check the trace with the Extended Events, we can see that the driver is encrypting that information when it sends the query to the SQL Server instance:

	And the query is:

	```sql
	exec sp_executesql N'SELECT * FROM [Expense].[Employee] WHERE BankAccountNumber=@BankAccountNumber',N'@BankAccountNumber nvarchar(17)',@BankAccountNumber=0x0140D73D5BC35CB0C64F1D707435FE1E598DF304CE168AC35F6FC914346F759A30CD24FB0E7C5CDBDBBB1693935E1CD59CB3E3E723EF4EB3A450A678E0B6AD235B35FAC6B0AA3A55DBE6C178314EEFC592660C6E7D92D9C2B3CD5016AD13F8D246
	```

	Note how even querying the data with actual values, the driver will send it as encrypted data: we have encryption in transit as well as at rest. This means that even in the event of a man in the middle attack between the client and the server, the information is safe.
