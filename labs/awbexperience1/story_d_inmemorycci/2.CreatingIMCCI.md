CREATING AN IN MEMORY COLUMNSTORE INDEX TABLE
====

1. Let's begin the creation of the new In-Memory Clustered ColumnStore in our database. First we will need a memory optimized data FileGroup, where we will store our optimized data. To create it, execute the following statement:

	```sql
	ALTER DATABASE [ExpensesDWH] ADD FILEGROUP ExpensesInmemory CONTAINS MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_DATA   
	```

2. Now, let's create the memory optimized data in our new FileGroup:

	```sql
	ALTER DATABASE [ExpensesDWH] ADD FILE (name='expenses_file1', filename='c:\data_expensesdwh_file1') TO FILEGROUP ExpensesInmemory   
	ALTER DATABASE [ExpensesDWH] SET MEMORY_OPTIMIZED_ELEVATE_TO_SNAPSHOT=ON  
	```

3. Change the name to the current FactExpense table to a temporal name.

	```sql
	EXEC sp_rename '[dwh].[FactExpense]', 'FactExpenseTemp'
	```
 
4. Once we have the data in the FileGroup ready, we can create a new in memory table with clustered columnstore index. It will have the same schema as the current FactExpense table, since we will replace the old one with the optimized version.

	```sql
	CREATE TABLE [dwh].[FactExpense] (  
		[IdExpense] [int] NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED,
		[IdCalendar] [int] NOT NULL,
		[IdExpenseCategory] [smallint] NOT NULL,
		[IdCostCenter] [smallint] NOT NULL,
		[IdEmployee] [int] NOT NULL,
		[IdReport] [int] NOT NULL,
		[Amount] [decimal](10, 2) NOT NULL,
		INDEX ExpenseCCI CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE  
	)WITH (MEMORY_OPTIMIZED = ON );
	```

	Note the inclusion of the *INDEX ExpenseCCI CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE*, in order to define a clustered columnstore index, and the *WITH (MEMORY_OPTIMIZED = ON)* that marks the table as memory optimized.

5. Let's insert the data from current FactExpenseTemp table into the new one. Be aware that this process may take some time.

	```sql
	INSERT INTO [dwh].[FactExpense] (IdExpense, IdCalendar, IdExpenseCategory, IdCostCenter, IdEmployee, IdReport, Amount)
	SELECT IdExpense, IdCalendar, IdExpenseCategory, IdCostCenter, IdEmployee, IdReport, Amount 
	FROM [dwh].[FactExpenseTemp]
	```

6. Once both tables have the same information, delete the temporal FactExpense

	```sql
	DROP TABLE [dwh].[FactExpenseTemp]
	```

 Now our In-Memory table is ready, it has a columnstore index, and we can compare our previous benchmark and statistics with new ones generated against it. Click *Next* to see it
