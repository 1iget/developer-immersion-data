REMOVING MASKING
====

As the last step, we’ll see how to remove a mask from a column. After careful consideration, we don't think masking is enough for the account number field (after all, it's still visible for a privileged user...or an attacker), and we'd like to find a better approach later on. For the time being, let's remove the mask.

1. Connect to your MyExpenses database using SQL Server Management Studio or SQL Server Data Tools, using the administrative login. 

    The default SQL credentials are: experience1/P2ssw0rd@Dev

2. Execute the following SQL statement 

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE [Expense].[Employee]
    ALTER COLUMN BankAccountNumber DROP MASKED;
    ```

    This will modify the Employee table to remove the mask applied to the BankAccountNumber column. Let’s see the results.

3. Connect to the MyExpenses again, using SQL Server Management Studio or SQL Server Data Tools and the read only login that you created in the previous step. 

    The SQL credentials are: itemployee/P2ssw0rd@Dev

4. Execute the following SQL statement to select the BankAccountNumber field for all the users

    ```sql
    SELECT BankAccountNumber FROM [Expense].[Employee];
    ```

5. Check the results and see how, after removing the mask, the results are once again shown without masking
