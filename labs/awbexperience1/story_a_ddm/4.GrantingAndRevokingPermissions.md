GRANTING AND REVOKING PERMISSIONS
====

You’ve seen how privileged users can still access the data in the original unmasked form, while a standard user cannot. Now you’ll see how to grant unmasking permissions to any user.

1. Connect to your MyExpenses database using SQL Server Management Studio or SQL Server Data Tools, using the administrative login. 

    The default SQL credentials are: experience1/P2ssw0rd

2. Execute the following SQL statement 

    ```sql
    GRANT UNMASK TO itemployee;
    ```

    This will modify the permissions of the itemployee so any queries against the Employee table (or any other in the database) will show the unmasked values. Let’s see the results.

3. Connect to the MyExpenses again, using SQL Server Management Studio or SQL Server Data Tools. This time however, use the read only login that you created in the previous step. 

    The SQL credentials are: itemployee/P2ssw0rd

4. Execute the following SQL statement to select the Email and BankAccountNumber fields for all the users

    ```sql
    SELECT Email, BankAccountNumber FROM [Expense].[Employee];
    ```

5. Check the results and see how, after granting UNMASK permissions to the users, the results are show without masking

6. To revoke the unmask permissions granted to a user, first connect to your database again, using SQL Server Management Studio or SQL Server Data Tools and the administrative login. 

    The default SQL credentials are: experience1/P2ssw0rd

7. Then, you need to execute the following SQL statement 

```sql
REVOKE UNMASK TO itemployee;
```

This will once again modify the permissions of the itemployee, revoking the unmask grant and preventing sensitive data from being snooped.
