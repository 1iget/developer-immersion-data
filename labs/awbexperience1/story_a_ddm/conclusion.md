CONCLUSION
====

You've now learned how to improve the security of our application by masking sensitive data and hiding it from the view of non-privileged users (and this is a very important part of it: privileged users can still access the information without restriction). You've also learned how to grant unmasking permissions to specific database users, and how to remove masking altogether. However, as you've seen, Dynamic Data Masking is not a magic bullet, and it doesn't solve the issue with the employees account number.
