ROW LEVEL SECURITY IN THE CLIENT (II)
====

There are three functions in charge of retrieving the Team expenses, that need to be modified to apply RLS

1. Scroll down to the `getReportsTeam` function. Replace this:

    ```javascript
    return countReportsTeam(userName, status, filter).then(function (count) {
        return ExpenseReport.findAll(conditions).then(function (reports) {
            return buildReportTeamsList(reports, pageIndex, pageSize, count, base_url);
        });
    });
    ```

    with this

    ```javascript
    return sequelize.transaction(function (t) {
        return sequelize.query('EXEC [Expense].[SetContextInfo] @Email=N\'' + employee.email + '\'', { transaction: t }).then(function () {
            return countReportsTeam(userName, status, filter, t).then(function (count) {
                conditions.transaction = t;
                return ExpenseReport.findAll(conditions).then(function (reports) {
                    return buildReportTeamsList(reports, pageIndex, pageSize, count, base_url);
                });
            });
        });
    });
    ```

2. Go to the `countReportsTeam` function. Replace the function header:

    ```javascript
    let countReportsTeam = function (userName, status, filter)
    ```

    with this one

    ```javascript
    let countReportsTeam = function (userName, status, filter, t)
    ```

    and also include these lines just before the `return ExpenseReport.count(conditions);` line:

    ```javascript
    if (t) {
        conditions.transaction = t;
    }
    ```

    We have just passed the transaction used by the `getReportsTeam`, so this function is called in the same one.

3. Finally, go to the `getReportsTeamSummary` function. Replace this:

    ```javascript
    return ExpenseReport.findAll(conditions).then((summary) => {
        return summary;
    });
    ```

    with this

    ```javascript
    return sequelize.transaction(function (t) {
        return sequelize.query('EXEC [Expense].[SetContextInfo] @Email=N\'' + employee.email + '\'', { transaction: t }).then(function () {
            conditions.transaction = t;
            return ExpenseReport.findAll(conditions).then((summary) => {
                return summary;
            });
        });
    });
    ```

And it's over! Now if you run the application logged in as a team manager, and head to the Team Expenses Section, you will see the reports of your team correctly displayed!
