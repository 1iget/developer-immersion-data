# CONCLUSION

Azure Data Lake Analytics is a new service built to make big data analytics easy. This service lets you focus on writing, running and managing jobs rather than operating distributed infrastructure. Instead of deploying, configuring and tuning hardware, you write queries to transform your data and extract valuable insights. 

The analytics service can handle jobs of any scale instantly by simply setting the dial for how much power you need. You only pay for your job when it is running making it cost-effective.
