# CONCLUSION

Azure SQL Data Warehouse is a cloud-based, scale-out database capable of processing massive volumes of data, both relational and non-relational. Built on our massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture, Azure SQL Data Warehouse can handle your enterprise workload.

-	Combines the SQL Server relational database with Azure cloud scale-out capabilities. You can increase, decrease, pause, or resume compute in seconds. You save costs by scaling out CPU when you need it, and cutting back usage during non-peak times.

-	Leverages the Azure platform. It's easy to deploy, seamlessly maintained, and fully fault tolerant because of automatic back-ups.

-	Complements the SQL Server ecosystem. You can develop with familiar SQL Server Transact-SQL (T-SQL) and tools.
