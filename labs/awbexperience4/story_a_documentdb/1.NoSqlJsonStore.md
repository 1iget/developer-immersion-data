# NoSQL JSON STORE

1. Open the application and click on a product to see the product details.	

	> In AdventureWorks we have two product stores, DocumentDB which is the master product store and the product index from within Azure Search. The product information which you see on this product details page is extracted directly from DocumentDB and passed to the browser for display.
	> Picking up DocumentDB to build applications  is extremely easy to develop new applications rapidly using familiar tools.

1. Click on the existing database.	

	> A database is a logical container of document storage partitioned across collections. 

	> AdventureWorks Bikes only use one database to store all the information related to products and stores.

	![](img/image11.jpg)

	> It has four different collections.

	> A collection is a container of JSON documents and the associated JavaScript application logic. A collection is a billable entity, where the cost is determined by the performance level associated within the collection. Collections can span one or more partitions/servers and can be horizontally scaled to handle practically unlimited volumes of storage or throughput.

1. Expand the DocumentDB project.	

	> DocumentDB supports the use of HTTP methods to create, read, replace, get, and delete DocumentDB resources using the REST API.

	> DocumentDB allows us to use industry-standard JavaScript, industry-standard JSON, and industry-standard RESTful over HTTP API calls so you can get up and running quickly

	> AdventureWorks Bikes uses the existing REST API to use the DocumentDB service.

	> The DocumentDB REST API supports the following:
	
	>	- Access control to resources.
	
	>	- Query functionality for resources.
	
	>	- Basic CRUD operations for resources.

	> The DocumentDB project contains all the methods to access to the DocumentDB service.
