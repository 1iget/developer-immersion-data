    > When applying changes to the source code, you will need to follow several steps to see those changes reflected on the Azure Cosmos DB database.

    > This section explains you how to do it.

1. Click on the resource group created.

1. Click on the Cosmos DB account.	

    > When the application starts, it invokes a initializer which is in charge of creating the database and all the collections attached to it.

    > However, if the database already exists, it will not do anything. So, to apply any changes you do, you will need to delete the Cosmos DB database first.
