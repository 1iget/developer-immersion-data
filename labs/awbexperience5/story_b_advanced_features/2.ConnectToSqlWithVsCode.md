# CONNECT TO ``SQL Server 2016 on Linux``

To connect to our SQL Server 2016 on Linux running on docker container we can use any of the
connection tools available but in this lab we are going to connect with ``VS Code``
(Visual Studio Code) and the ``mssql`` extension. 

## Install mssql extension

1. Open ``Visual Studio Code``

1. Press **CTRL+SHIFT+P** (or **F1**) to open the Command Palette in VS Code.

1. Select ``Install Extension`` and type ``mssql``.  

    > You have complete instructions on the [mscode extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-develop-use-vscode)
    web page.

1. Click on install ``mssql``.

1. Select the **MS SQL: Connect** command. You can simply type **sqlcon** and press **ENTER**.

1. Select **Create Connection Profile**.  

    > This creates a connection profile for your SQL Server 2016 on Linux.

1. Follow the prompts to specify the connection properties for the new connection profile.  

1. After specifying each value, press **ENTER** to continue.    

    If you have followed these lab instructions, then this is your connection data:

    > | Data | Value | Observations |
    > |------|-------|--------------|
    > | Server Name | **localhost,11433** | _Remember to separate host name and port with comma_ |
    > | Database name |  | _Leave this empty_ |
    > | User name | **sa** | |
    > | Password |**P2ssw0rd** | |
    > | Save Password? | **Yes** | _If you choose **No** you will be prompted for it every time_ |
    > | Enter a name for this Profile | **localhost-docker** | _If you want to save this profile with a name, enter it here_ |

    We will name this connection: **``localhost-docker``**

    > **Tip**
    > You can create and edit connection profiles in the User Settings file (settings.json).  
    > Open the settings file by selecting **Preference** and then **User Settings** in the VS Code menu.  
    >  
    > For more details, see [manage connection profiles](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-mssql/wiki/manage-connection-profiles).

1. In your ``VS Code`` type this.

    ```sql 
        SELECT name FROM sys.databases  
        GO
    ```
    
1. Press **CTRL+SHIFT+E** to run the query and list the existing databases in your SQL Server instance
