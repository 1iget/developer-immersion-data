# INTRODUCTION

MyExpenses is an demo app that aims to provide a comprehensive expense tracking system for companies all over the world. 
Every employee can log expenses using the MyExpenses web portal and get them reimbursed in either cash or company points, which can be spent in the company store without leaving MyExpenses. 
Managers can do everything an employee can, but also review, approve or reject the expense reports submitted by team members. 

You can find the demo app in the `source\Expenses.SQLLinux` directory. 

You need to copy the content of this directory to your own computer to complete this lab.

**IMPORTANT:** You must use your own workstation to complete the lab, not the Azure virtual machine.
