POWERBI EMBEDDED

MyExpenses is an application that aims to provide a comprehensive expense tracking system for companies all over the world. Every employee can log expenses using the MyExpenses web portal and get them reimbursed in either cash or company points, which can be spent in the company store without leaving MyExpenses. Managers can do everything an employee can, but also review, approve or reject the expense reports submitted by team members.

MyExpenses is built on top of a SQL Server 2016 database, with a frontend in AngularJS and a backend using Node.js. SQL Server allows us to easily scale the services offered to our clients and provide a good performance. One of the features offered by MyExpenses is getting an expense reinbursed in company points, which can be spent directly in the website. We want to provide additional information about the existent products in our catalog, in particular the games currently available in the catalog. When doing something like this, it is common to use a service that provides an APIs to get all the available information about a videogame, and you usually obtain this information in a JSON format. But it would be a heavy task having to parse all the possible information to new columns to the table. Besides, it wouldn't be a good idea because our catalog comprises not only videogames, but hardware and other software products, so these new columns wouldn't make any sense and we should create a new table just for the videogame catalog. Instead of that, we are going to take advantage of the JSON capabilities to see how easy is to store the information provided in JSON by a web service in our table. 

PowerBI Embedded
------------------
Power BI Embedded is an Azure service that enables ISVs and app developers to surface Power BI data experiences within their applications. As a developer, you've built applications, and those applications have their own users and distinct set of features. Those apps may also happen to have some built-in data elements like charts and reports that can now be powered by Microsoft Power BI Embedded. Users donâ€™t need a Power BI account to use your app. They can continue to sign in to your application just like before, and view and interact with the Power BI reporting experience without requiring any additional licensing.
 
Currently, the application has a section called Reports. This menu's element points to a report created with SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), which is a server-based report generating software system.

In this lab we are going to see how we can create a report with PowerBI desktop to show the expenses generated by the employees through the year. After that, we will take advatange of the PowerBI Emmbedded capabilities to see how easily is to integrate our report in the website, letting all the employees see the the report and interact with it, without needing to have a PowerBI account.
