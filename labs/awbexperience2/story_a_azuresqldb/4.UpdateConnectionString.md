UPDATE CONNECTION STRING IN THE WEB APPLICATION
====

Once all the databases have been migrated to the Azure SQL Server, the only remaining step is to update the endpoints of our website, so it knows where to find the new databases.

1. Open the file "server\config\server.config.js". 

2. Inside the options node, update the host with the new one and also add the new "dialectOptions" node. This node is mandatory after the migration because the communication with Azure SQL Server is always encrypted:

    ```js
    options: {
            host: process.env.databaseServer || '<inject key="sqlazureservername" />',
            dialect: 'mssql',
            dialectOptions: {
                encrypt: true
            },
            pool: {
                max: 5,
                min: 0,
                idle: 10000
            }
        }
    ``` 

3. Save the file, and open the website. It should work without issue!
