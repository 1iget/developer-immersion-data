## Scenario 1: Globally distributed application for experiencing low latency


### Part A - Accessing the Azure Portal

  > _We'll start with accessing_ **Azure Portal.** _For creating resources, you need to_ **Sign in** _to_ **Azure Portal** _. The steps to do the same are given below:_

1. Click on the link [Azure Portal](http://portal.azure.com) to open **Azure Portal** and maximize the browser window.
1. Sign in with your **Azure username** and **password**:
    - Username: **<inject key="AzureAdUserEmail" />**
    - Password: **<inject key="AzureAdUserPassword" />**
1. Click on **Sign in** button. ![](img/signIn.jpg)
1. You may encounter a popup entitled **Welcome to Microsoft Azure** with options to **Start Tour** and **Maybe Later** Choose **Maybe Later**. [Ignore the Step no. 4 if didn't get the popup message]

   > _Great! You are now logged in to the Azure Portal._

### Part B - Deployment of Resources Through Ansible Playbooks

   > _Here first of all we will see how we can deploy resources such as Azure Cosmos DB Account through Ansible Playbooks._

1. Launch **Bash on Ubuntu on Windows**. Click on **Ubuntu bash Icon** ![](img/ubuntu.png). Bash shell will be launched. 
1. Follow the given steps to install **Ubuntu on Windows**. Press **y** to continue. This process may take some time.
![Fbash](img/fbash.png)
1. After completion of process close the **Ubuntu bash** and relaunch **Bash on Ubuntu on Windows** by clicking on **Ubuntu bash Icon** ![](img/ubuntu.png). And then continue with the given steps.
   > **Note:** It will ask to create **username and password**, ignore it and close the bash. As in our case we need to execute all the commands with root user only. And then again relaunch the bash from desktop.

1. Execute the following commands in bash shell to install **Ansible** and then execute the playbook.
   ```cmd
   apt-get update && apt-get install -y libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev python-pip
   ```
   ```cmd
   pip install ansible[azure]
   ```  
   > **Note:** This will take some time to install packages of Ansible in bash.
1. Create a folder where you will save and execute your **Ansible Playbook**. Follow given steps for the same. 
1. Execute the command given below to create a folder and then navigate to the same folder.
   ```cmd
   mkdir ansible
   ```
   > **Note:** Command to create the folder.

   ```cmd
   cd ansible
   ```
   > **Note:** Command to navigate to the same folder.

   ```cmd
   vi ansible_playbook.yml
   ```
   > **Note:** Command to open **vi editor** and create **.yml** file.

1. Press **I** button from keyboard to enable **insert** mode in **vi editor**. 
   ![Insert](img/insert.png)
1. Copy the **yml** content given below.

   > **Note:** If the browser refresh continously then please open the **localhost URL** [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in different browser i.e. **Edge browser** ![File](img/file.png)

1. It will show the time required to retrieve the flights data from **South Central US** region at the **top of the webpage.**
1. The time showing in the milliseconds would be showing High Latency or Low Latency it depends on your current region.
   ![](img/newpopup.jpg)
   > **NOTE:**
   > **Suppose your current region is South Central US and the database is also present in South Central US region then it will give you Low Latency, but for the region which is far away from your current region you will face High Latency.**
   > **The concept of**  **high**  **latency will be better understood if your current location is far away from the region where your database is located.**


### Part F Global Database Replication

   > Replication protects your data and preserves your application up-time in the event of transient hardware failures. If your data is replicated to a second data centre, it's protected from a catastrophic failure in the primary location.

   > Replication ensures that your storage account meets the  [Service-Level Agreement (SLA) for Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/storage) even in the face of failures. See the SLA for information about Azure Storage guarantees for durability and availability.

   > _To test the above scenario of_ **Part D** _lets replicate the database into multiple regions below is the procedure for the same._

   > **NOTE:** **Cosmos DB Account** named as " **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDBWithSQLDBName"/>"** _is already present in the_ **Resource group** _named_ **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="myResourceGroupName"/>** _which is present in_ **South Central US.**

1. Go to **Resource groups** option ![](img/ResourceGropus.jpg) present in the favourites menu on the left side panel and select the resource group **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="myResourceGroupName"/>**.
1. Click on **Cosmos DB Account** named **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDBWithSQLDBName"/>**
1. Click on **Replicate data globally**![](img/ReplicateDataGlobally.jpg) option present under **Cosmos DB Account** blade.

   ![](img/centralIndia.jpg)

1. Select the **region** or **multiple** regions in which you want to **replicate** the database by clicking on hexagon icon.

   > **For experiencing the Latency difference replicate Azure Cosmos DB;**
   > - **Near to your current location (Low Latency).**
   > - **Far away from your current location (High Latency).**

   > **For e.g.** Select region which is near to your current region i.e. **Japan East and Australia Southeast** to replicate the database.

1. Click **Save** button. To view the deployment process, click **Notification Icon**![](img/BellIcon.jpg).

   > **Note** :
   > - It takes some time near about 8 to 10 mins to complete the deployment of the resources till then let's take you to the concept of Multi-homing API's.

   > - You can distribute your data to any number of Azure regions, with the click of a button. This enables you to put your data where your users are, ensuring the lowest possible latency to your customers.

   > - Using Azure Cosmos DB's multi-homing APIs, the app always knows where the nearest region is and sends requests to the nearest data centre. All of this is possible with no config changes. You set your write-region and as many read-regions as you want, and the rest is handled for you for more details click on given link [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction)

1. Click on **Go to resource group** button to view the successfully created resource group.
1. Click on   ![](img/CancelButton.jpg) to close the **notification** window.

   **OR**

1. You can go to **Resource groups** option present in the favourites menu on the left side panel and click on it to check the status of the created **replicated Cosmos DB.**
1. Once the replication process is completed, again switchto **Visual studio 2017** IDE and open **Config.js** file present under project " **ContosoAir.Services"** from the **Solution Explorer** window **.**
1. Now change **DOCUMENT_DB_PREFERRED_REGION**  **'Name of the region where you replicated the database i.e. Read region'** and save the file.

   > For e.g. **Central India.**

   ![](img/centralIndia.jpg)

1. Go to **Command Prompt** which was already launched in **Step 1** of **Part D**. Stop the services by typing **CTRL+C,** command this will terminate the process. Again, execute the command given below.

   ```cmd
   npm start
   ```
   > **Note:** We are doing this step so that all the changes done in the service will gets reflected.

   ![](img/npmStartnew.jpg)

1. Go to browser where you have launched **ContosoAir Website** and refresh the page and enter **Departure date** and **Return date** in **YYYY-MM-DD** format and click **Find Flights** button.
1. Now, you will observe that after replication to the region near your current region it will take **less time to retrieve flight data**. It will show the time required to fetch data on website on the top of page ( **Low latency** ).

   > _Remember you created Azure Function in Part C, now let's check how the Flight deals data is reflected in ContosoAir Website._
   ![](img/newpopup2.jpg)

   > _Awesome! In this scenario, you came across Turnkey global distribution and_ **Low Latency** _feature of_ **Azure Cosmos DB.**
