## Scenario 3: Multi-model API

   > _Till now you have used the SQL DB API of Azure Cosmos DB to store and fetch Flights, Deals, Seats and Booking data in ContosoAir Website._

   > _But Azure Cosmos DB is not only limited to SQL DB you can also use the MongoDB API, Graph DB API and Table API to store your data._

   > _Let's see how we can use the different types of Database in a single application._

### Part A - Integrating Mongo DB with ContosoAir Website

   > _Here you will perform the steps to connect your Mongo Db with ContosoAir Website to fetch Flights feedback data which will be displayed in graphical format._

1. Go to **Resource groups** option present on the favourites menu bar present at the left then, click on **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="myResourceGroupName"/>**.
1. Click on **Mongo DB Account** named **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDBWithMongoDBName"/>** which is already present in the same Resource group.
1. Click on **Connection String** option present under **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDBWithMongoDBName"/>** blade and copy **CONNECTION STRING** URL by clicking on ![](img/copyIcon.jpg) icon.
1. Now, switch to **Visual Studio 2017** IDE and go to **Config.js** file present in **ContosoAir.Services** project in **Solution Explorer**.
1. Paste the **MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING** URL in **Config.js** file.

   > **Note:** Give any Collection name of your choice against **MONGO\_DB\_COLLECTION** key in **config.js** file.

   > _Now we will see how the data is reflected in ContosoAir website._
     
   ```js
   MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING: 'Connection String URL'',

   MONGO_DB_COLLECTION: 'flightfeedback',
   ```

   > _Good work! You now created connection between your database and Website._

### Part B - Inserting collections in Mongo DB Account.

   > _Let's import data in already existing Mongo DB Account named <inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDBWithMongoDBName"/> in Resource group named <inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="myResourceGroupName"/>._

1. Go to **Visual Studio 2017** IDE and open **"mongo_db_insert.js"** utility present under **ContosoAir.Services** project by double clicking on it in **Solution Explorer**
   ![](img/MongoDBSolnExplorer.jpg)

   > **Below is the code snippet for the same. In this Nodejs code you will see how you can insert the data in Mongo DB.  Please go through the code and read the comments for better clarity.**

   > **You can also open the same code snippet inside visual studio by going to Services Project and then open mongo_db_insert.js**

   ```js
    // private variable's Declaration
    var fs = require('fs');
    var MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
    var config = require('./config')
    var assert = require('assert');
    var ObjectId = require('mongodb').ObjectID;
    var connectionString = config.MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING;
    var collection = config.MONGO_DB_COLLECTION;

    // Reading Feedback data from JSON file and hold it in a variable.
    var data_to_import = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('./api/feedback/feedback.data.json', 'utf8'));

    // Functions Declaration
    // Insert Feedback data into MongoDB Database
    var insertDocument = function (db, callback) {
        for (var i = 0; i < data_to_import.length; i++) {
         // Insert the data one by one into the MongoDB collection
            db.collection(collection).insertOne(data_to_import[i], function (err, result) {
                assert.equal(err, null);
                callback();
            });
        }
        console.log('Data imported successfully into the ' + collection + ' collection.');
    };
    // Execution starts
    // Set the database connection string property of the MongoDB client object.
    MongoClient.connect(connectionString, function (err, db) {
        assert.equal(null, err);
        insertDocument(db, function () {
            db.close();
            process.exit();
        });
    });

   ```

1. Also, right click on **"mongo_db_insert.js"** utility present under **ContosoAir.Services** and click **Open folder in file explorer** option and copy the path of the folder.

1. Open **Command prompt** window ![](img/CommandPrompt.jpg)  and type command: cd <Copied path from **Step 3**>

   > For e.g. >cd  C:\source\experience1\src\ContosoAir.Services

1. Now execute the following command in command prompt and press enter, flights feedback data will be imported successfully into your **Mongo DB Account** named **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDBWithMongoDBName"/>.**
   ```cmd
   node mongo_db_insert.js
   ```
   ![](img/mongodatainsert.jpg)

1. Switch to **Azure Portal** as launched in **Scenario 1**, navigate to Resource groups option present in the favourites menu on the left side panel and select the resource group **"<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="myResourceGroupName"/>**" and click on **MongoDB Account** **"<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDBWithMongoDBName"/>**".
1. Go to **Data Explorer** option present under **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDBWithMongoDBName"/>** Then go to your collection named **flightfeedback** which was imported through previous steps and click on it to expand.
1. Click on **Documents** option, Json data with ID's will appear on left side panel.

   > **Now we will see how we can fetch the Mongo DB data and SQL data from the database.**

   > **In this Nodejs code you will see how you can fetch the data from Mongo DB.  Please go through the code and read the comments for better clarity.**
  
   > **You can also open the same code snippet inside visual studio by going to Services Project and open api folder and then open flights folder and then open flights.controller.js and inside that go to line no. 106**

   ```js
    // Fetch flight feedback data from MongoDB
    let getFlightFeedback = function (req, res) {	
	    // Set the database connection string property of the MongoDB client object.
        MongoClient.connect(MongoDBConnectionString, function (err, db) {
            if (err) {
                res.send(err);
                console.log("Connection Failed")
            }
            else {
	    // Fetch the data from the MongoDB collection
                db.collection(MongoDBCollection).find(req.params).toArray(function (err, result) {
                    if (err) {
                        res.send(err);
                        console.log("Error in data fetching")
                    }

                        Poor_Feedbacks = 0;

                        // Calculate the count of overall feedback according to different factors
                        for (var i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
                            if (result[i].textAnalyticScore <= 0.33) {
                                Poor_Feedbacks++;
                            }
                            else if (result[i].textAnalyticScore <= 0.66) {
                                Average_Feedbacks++;
                            }
                            else {
                                Good_Feedbacks++;
                            }
                        }
                        db.close();
                        var response = '{' +
                            '"Poor_Feedbacks" : "' + Poor_Feedbacks + '",' +

                            '}'

                        res.send(JSON.parse(response));
                    }
                });
            }
        });
    }

   ```

   > **You can also open the same code snippet inside visual studio by going to Services Project and open api folder and then open flights folder and then open flights.controller.js and inside that go to line no. 44**

   ```js
    // Get flight data from SQLDB API
    let get = (req, res) => {

    };

   ```
   > _Congratulations! Your Mongo DB data is imported successfully into your Mongo DB Account._

### Part C Launching ContosoAir website to see flights feedback data

   > _In this part, you will come across how to enable the services and launch ContosoAir website to see how the data is retrieved in ContosoAir website._

1. Go to **command prompt** window of **services** which is already opened and then stop the services by pressing **CTRL+C** keys and again start the services by executing the command
   ```cmd
    npm start
   ```
   > **Note:** We are doing this step so that all the changes done in the service will gets reflected.

1. Now switch to **ContosoAir Website** which is already launched in browser refresh the page and enter **Departure date** and **Return date** in **YYYY-MM-DD** format and click **Find Flights** button.

   ![](img/ContosoAirApp.jpg)

1. Flight details will be displayed then, click on one of the flight ID links(present in the flight details).
   > **Note:** Feedback Graph will going to appear in the middle of the screen. So please scroll down to see.
1. **Flights feedback** data will be displayed in graphical format which is coming from Mongo DB database.

   ![](img/Graphmultimodel.jpg)

   > _Awesome! Here you came across how you used SQL DB and Mongo DB API of Azure Cosmos DB into same application (website) i.e. Multi-Modal API which is one of the feature of Azure Cosmos DB._

   > _Flights details is stored in SQL DB and Flight feedback data is stored in Mongo DB._

### Part D Automatic regional failover for business continuity in Azure Cosmos DB

   > Cosmos DB supports both explicit and policy driven failovers that allow you to control the end-to-end system behaviour in the event of failures.

#### Configuring multi-region applications

   > _Before we dive into failover modes, we look at how you can configure an application to take advantage of multi-region availability and be resilient in the face of regional failovers._

   > **ContosoAir website** is already deployed in multiple regions.

   > To ensure low latency access from every region your application is deployed, configure the corresponding  [**preferred regions list**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/microsoft.azure.documents.client.connectionpolicy.preferredlocations.aspx#P:Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Client.ConnectionPolicy.PreferredLocations) for each region via, **config.js** file.

#### Automatic Failover

1. In the rare event of an **Azure regional outage**, **data centre outage** , **Cosmos DB** automatically **triggers failovers** of all **Cosmos DB accounts** with a presence in the affected region.
1. **Cosmos DB** accounts with a **read region** in one of the affected regions are **automatically disconnected** from their **write**** region **and marked** offline.
1. The **Cosmos DB SDKs** implement a regional discovery protocol that allows them to automatically detect when a region is available and **redirect read calls** to the next **available region** in the **preferred region** list. If none of the regions in the preferred region list is available, calls automatically fall back to the current write region.
1. Once the affected region **recovers from the outage** , all the affected **Cosmos DB accounts** in the region **are automatically recovered** by the service. **Cosmos DB accounts** that had a read region in the affected region will then automatically sync with current write region and turn **online**.
1. The **Cosmos DB SDKs** discover the availability of the new region and evaluate whether the region should be selected as the current read region based on the **preferred region list** configured by the application.

   > _Now let's see how to change priorities of preferred region list._

1. Navigate to **Azure Portal's** **Resource groups** option present in the favourites menu on the left side panel and select the resource group **"<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="myResourceGroupName"/>**" and click on **Azure Cosmos DB Account** **"<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDBWithSQLDBName"/>"**.
1. Click on **Replicate data globally** option present under **Cosmos DB Account** blade. Then click on **Automatic Failover** menu present on the top of page.

   ![](img/automaticFailover.jpg)

1. If the affected region is the current write region and automatic failover is enabled for the **Azure Cosmos DB account** , then the region is automatically marked as **offline**. Then, an alternative region is promoted as the **write** region for the affected **Azure Cosmos DB account**.
1. Once you get redirected to **Automatic Failover** page, click **ON button** to enable automatic failover.
1. Drag-and-drop read regions items to reorder the failover priorities.

    ![](img/failover2.jpg)

1. Click **OK button**![](img/OKbutton.jpg)to save the changes made.
1. Once the affected region recovers from the **outage** , all the affected **Cosmos DB accounts** in the region are **automatically** recovered by the service.

   > _Given is the concept of Automatic failover. Now let's dive into the concept of Manual failover._

#### Manual Failover

1. In addition to **automatic failovers**, the current **write region** of a given **Cosmos DB account** can be manually changed dynamically to one of the existing **read regions**.
1. Manual failovers ensure  **zero data loss**  and  **zero availability**  loss and gracefully transfer write status from the old write region to the new one for the specified Cosmos DB account.
1. Like in automatic failovers, the Cosmos DB SDK automatically handles write region changes during manual failovers and ensures that calls are automatically redirected to the new write region.
1. Navigate to **Azure Portal's** **Resource groups** option present in the favourites menu on the left side panel and select the resource group **"<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="myResourceGroupName"/>**" and click on **Azure Cosmos DB Account** **"<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDBWithSQLDBName"/>"**.
1. Click on **Replicate data globally** option present under **Cosmos DB Account** blade. Then click on **Manual Failover** menu present on the top of page.

   ![](img/ManualFailover.jpg)

1. Once you get redirected to the **Manual failover** page, select a **Read Region** to change it into the new **Write** **Region**.
1. Click on check **box**  **I understand and agree to trigger a failover on my current Write Region** given below and click **OK button** to save the changes done.

   ![](img/ManualFailover1.jpg)

1. If your applications have predictable traffic patterns based on the time of the day, you can periodically change the write status to the most active geographic region based on time of the day.

   > _In this article, we understood how manual and automatic failovers work in Cosmos DB, and how you can configure your Cosmos DB accounts and applications to be globally available. By using Cosmos DB's global replication support, you can improve end-to-end latency and ensure that they are highly available even in the event of region failures._
