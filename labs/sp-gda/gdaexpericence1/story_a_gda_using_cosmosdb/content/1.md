## Scenario 2: Consistency

### Part A Distributed databases and consistency
   > Data consistency means the data is same across all the regions at any given point of time.

   > Currently, **Azure Cosmos DB** provides five consistency levels: **strong** , **bounded**, **staleness**, **session**, **consistent prefix**, and **eventual** in this experience we are using **session** as a default consistency level.

1. Switch to **Azure Portal** by clicking on the link [http://portal.azure.com](launch://launch_azure_portal) as launched in **Scenario 1**, navigate to Resource groups option present in the favourites menu on the left side panel and select the resource group **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="myResourceGroupName"/>** and click on **Azure Cosmos DB Account** **"<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDBWithSQLDBName"/>"**.

1. Click on **Replicate data globally**![](img/ReplicateDataGlobally.jpg) option present under **Cosmos DB Account** blade.

   ![](img/WriteRegion.jpg)

1. As shown in above image your write region is **South Central US** using this way you can see the write region, all the operations associated to insert, update, delete will get performed on **write region** only.
1. Switch to **Visual Studio 2017** IDE and go to **Config.js** file present in **ContosoAir.Services** project in **Solution Explorer**.
1. Change the **DOCUMENT\_DB\_PREFERRED\_REGION:**  **'Name of the region from where you have to perform database operation'** and save **config.js** file.

   > **For eg.** South Central US (Write region in this case)

   > **NOTE:** Here your default write region is South Central US. The purpose for setting DOCUMENT\_DB\_REGION parameter in config.js file is to fetch the updated data from that write region only.

1. Go to **command prompt** window of **services** which is already opened and then stop the services by pressing **CTRL+C** keys and again start the services by executing the command
   ```cmd
   >npm start
   ```
   > **Note:** We are doing this step so that all the changes done in the service will gets reflected.

1. Now switch to **ContosoAir Website** which is already launched in browser from **Scenario 1** refresh the page and enter **Departure date** and **Return date** in **YYYY-MM-DD** format and click **Find Flights** button.

1. Flights details will be displayed then select one flight by clicking on radio button present at the left most end and click **Next** button at the bottom of the page.

1. Click on **Purchase** button to purchase the flight ticket.

1. Now again switch to **Visual Studio 2017** IDE and go to **Config.js** file present in **ContosoAir.Services** project in **Solution Explorer** window.
1. Change the **DOCUMENT\_DB\_PREFERRED\_REGION** : **'Name of the read region which is far away from write region'** save the **config.js**

   > **NOTE:** Here the data is getting fetched from the region stated in **Config.js** file.

1. Repeat the steps from **6 to 8** , you will observe that the seat you booked previously is marked with gray color.

   > **NOTE:**
   > - Here you will experience the **Session** Consistency of **Azure Cosmos DB**, which is the default consistency level.
   > - Though the preferred region is set to the region which is far away from write region, you will experience that the changes done in one database will get reflected quickly in another database too.

1. Now Switch to **Azure Portal** by clicking on the link [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/) as launched in **Scenario 2**, navigate to **Resource groups** option present in the favourites menu on the left side panel and select the resource group **"<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="myResourceGroupName"/>**" and click on **Azure Cosmos DB Account** **<inject story-id="story://Content-Private/content/dfd/SP-GDA/gdaexpericence1/story_a_gda_using_cosmosdb" key="cosmosDBWithSQLDBName"/>**.

1. Click on ![](img/DefaultConsistency.jpg) option present under **Azure Cosmos DB account** blade.


   ![](img/ConsistencyLevel.jpg)

1. You can change the consistency levels from the options available **STRONG** , **BOUNDED STALENESS, SESSION, CONSISTENT PREFIX, EVENTUAL** as shown in above image and follow the **Steps 1 to 12** to observe the behavior of Cosmos DB using **ContosoAir** website.

   > _Awesome! You deep dived into Multiple, well-defined consistency levels of Azure Cosmos DB. That was not that tough at all._
